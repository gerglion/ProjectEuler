Description
-----------

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

   | 1634 = 1\ :sup:`4`\  + 6\ :sup:`4`\  + 3\ :sup:`4`\  + 4\ :sup:`4`\ 
   | 8208 = 8\ :sup:`4`\  + 2\ :sup:`4`\  + 0\ :sup:`4`\  + 8\ :sup:`4`\ 
   | 9474 = 9\ :sup:`4`\  + 4\ :sup:`4`\  + 7\ :sup:`4`\  + 4\ :sup:`4`\ 

As 1 = 1\ :sup:`4`\  is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
