Description
-----------
Consider all integer combinations of |ab| for 2 ≤ *a* ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 5:

    | 2\ :sup:`2`\ = 4, 2\ :sup:`3`\ = 8, 2\ :sup:`4`\ = 16, 2\ :sup:`5`\ = 32
    |
    | 3\ :sup:`2`\ = 9, 3\ :sup:`3`\ = 27, 3\ :sup:`4`\ = 81, 3\ :sup:`5`\ = 243
    |
    | 4\ :sup:`2`\ = 16, 4\ :sup:`3`\ = 64, 4\ :sup:`4`\ = 256, 4\ :sup:`5`\ = 1024
    |
    | 5\ :sup:`2`\ = 25, 5\ :sup:`3`\ = 125, 5\ :sup:`4`\ = 625, 5\ :sup:`5`\ = 3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by |ab| for 2 ≤ *a* ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 100?

.. |ab| replace:: a\ :sup:`b`
